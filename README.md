# Part 1:

After researching various star matching algorithms, we have chosen the Simple Triangle Similarity Method (STSM) as a simple and efficient method for our implementation. The chosen algorithm focuses on matching two images, with one containing hundreds of star references and the other having 10-20 target stars. Our approach leverages the triangle similarity technique, which is computationally efficient and easy to implement. By using this method, we aim to achieve accurate star matching across different image resolutions, star densities, and quality levels. The STSM not only demonstrates robust performance but also adapts well to various observing conditions, making it a valuable tool for both amateur and professional astronomers.
